/*
 * Computes "magic info" for performing unsigned division by a fixed
 * positive integer D.  The type 'uint' is assumed to be defined as
 * an unsigned integer type large enough to hold both the dividend
 * and the divisor. num_bits can be set appropriately if n is known
 * to be smaller than the largest uint; if this is not known then
 * pass (sizeof(uint) * CHAR_BIT) for num_bits.
 *
 * Assume we have a hardware register of width UINT_BITS, a known
 * constant D which is not zero and not a power of 2, and a variable
 * n of width num_bits (which may be up to UINT_BITS). To emit code
 * for n/d, use one of the two following sequences (here >>> refers
 * to a logical bitshift):
 *
 *     m = compute_unsigned_magic_info(D, num_bits)
 *     if m.pre_shift > 0: emit("n >>>= m.pre_shift")
 *     if m.increment: emit("n = saturated_increment(n)")
 *     emit("result = (m.multiplier * n) >>> UINT_BITS")
 *     if m.post_shift > 0: emit("result >>>= m.post_shift")
 *
 * or
 *
 *     m = compute_unsigned_magic_info(D, num_bits)
 *     if m.pre_shift > 0: emit("n >>>= m.pre_shift")
 *     emit("result = m.multiplier * n")
 *     if m.increment: emit("result = result + m.multiplier")
 *     emit("result >>>= UINT_BITS")
 *     if m.post_shift > 0: emit("result >>>= m.post_shift")
 *
 * The shifts by UINT_BITS may be "free" if the high half of the full
 * multiply is put in a separate register.
 *
 * saturated_increment(n) means "increment n unless it would wrap to 0," i.e.
 *    if n == (1 << UINT_BITS)-1: result = n
 *    else: result = n+1
 * A common way to implement this is with the carry bit. For example, on x86:
 *     add 1
 *     sbb 0
 *
 * Some invariants:
 *   1: At least one of pre_shift and increment is zero
 *   2: multiplier is never zero
 *
 * This code incorporates the "round down" optimization per ridiculous_fish.
